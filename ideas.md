#### Project Ideas

- [Dillion Megida](https://twitter.com/iamdillion): Generate HTML and CSS Goals from the designed layout.

- [Dillion Megida](https://twitter.com/iamdillion): Individual resizing of the elements instead of a general size.

- [Dillion Megida](https://twitter.com/iamdillion): Make use of other elements in place of divs such as paragraphs, headers and pictures.
- [Ankit Sridhar](https://instagram.com/mr_kryp70n1c): The "order" property should be added to control the order of appearance. flex-shrink can also be added to shrink the flexbox if necessary.
