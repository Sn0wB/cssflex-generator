## CSS-Flex Generator

I was inspired by [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)'s project - [CSS-Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.com/) - and decided to build something similar for flex containers.

The project provides an easy means for creating CSS Flex containers for flexible layouts.

It hasn't gotten to a beta version yet, so contributions for now is limited opinions and ideas.

Stay Tuned!
