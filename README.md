## CSS-Flex Generator

I was inspired by [Sarah Drasner](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo)'s project - [CSS-Grid Generator](https://cssgrid-generator.netlify.com/) - and decided to build something similar for flex containers.

### Introduction

Ever since the introduction of Flex and Grid Containers, layouts have become easy to create as they are also flexible.

This project provides an easy means for creating CSS Flex containers for flexible layouts.
It aids in efficient understanding of the flex property and (soon) it would be able to generate codes.
It was built with basic React by create-react-app

### Goals for the project
- Make use of other elements in place of divs such as paragraphs, headers and pictures.
- Individual resizing of the elements instead of a general size
- Generate HTML and CSS Goals from the designed layout.
